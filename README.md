# Info
Collection of sequencing adapter/primer sequences (mainly Illumina) from all around the internet. I appologize but this list is so old I no longer remember most of the sources where I got it from.

Each adapter has it's reverse-complement "version" at the end since I've observed this "version" in the past at some experiments.
